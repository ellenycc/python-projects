# Python Projects

This repository contains my notes from the Python projects that I am currently working on. All the code examples from this course by Mosh Hamedani can be found [here](https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/python-projects-for-beginners). These notes aim to capture my learning process, highlight key concepts, and demonstrate my understanding of Python.
